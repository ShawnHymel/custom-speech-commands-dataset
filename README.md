# Custom Speech Commands Dataset

Collection of various spoken words and phrases for use in voice recognition systems. Feel free to use this with the [Keyword Spotting with Edge Impulse](https://github.com/ShawnHymel/ei-keyword-spotting) project.

There is no naming scheme because I'm lazy. If you use this dataset with the project listed above, samples are randomized, mixed, and renamed anyway.
